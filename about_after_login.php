        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>This Website is for maintaining the attedance of all the students.</p>
        <p>Regular attendance at College for every student is essential if students are to
achieve their potential, and increase their career and life options. Colleges in
partnerships with parents are responsible for promoting the regular attendance of
students. While parents are legally responsible for the regular attendance of their
children, College staff, as part of their duty of care, record and monitor part and
whole day absences. Colleges, in providing a caring teaching and learning
environment, which addresses the learning and support needs of students,
including those with additional learning and support needs or complex health
conditions, foster students’ sense of wellbeing and belonging to the College
community.</p>
<p>This document supports the College Attendance Policy (2015) and applies to all
Colleges  under Pune University.</p>
<p>Every student must have 75% of attendance in theory lectures and 100% of attendance in practicals. </p>

->provide a caring teaching and learning environment which fosters students’
sense of wellbeing and belonging to the school community.<br>
->promote regular attendance at school through teaching and learning activities
that acknowledge the learning and support needs of students.<br>
->maintain accurate records of student attendance.<br>
->alert the Head of Dept., or staff member responsible for monitoring attendance, when
a student’s pattern of attendance is of concern, or if no explanation is received
from the parent or carer within required time frames. <br>
->every month one defaulter list must be out with the students having less number of attendance for that particular month.</p>
<p>Strict action will be taken by the college athorities if any students have less attendace then the minimum requirements.
